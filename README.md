## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5  
- Vanilla CSS3  
- CSS Grid (notably `grid-template-areas` and `grid-template-columns`)  
- Mobile-first workflow  

### What I learned

I dug deep into advanced CSS Grid concepts, especially `grid-template-areas` which took some time to fully grasp. Handling responsiveness with `grid-template-columns` was a significant challenge, involving several iterations to achieve a smooth experience across all devices.

This project also allowed me to deepen my understanding of CSS architecture methodologies like BEM and ITCSS, which greatly improve long-term maintainability and code clarity.

### Continued development

I aim to keep improving scalability, maintainability, and most importantly, accessibility — the essential pillars for writing clean, professional, and sustainable code. Mastering these will make my projects more robust and easier to maintain.
